# Community Applications Hub

A command line tool for listing community applications or downloading an application package and installer to the current directory.

## Usage

`npm i -g community-applications-hub`

Make sure you don't have a SSB client running anywhere else. Run it from the directory where you'de like the packages to be downloaded to, or where the `apk` file you'd like to add is located at. Just run `community-apps` and interact with it.
